We're looking for new developers to lead DreamChess in 2007. The current team will be too busy with other projects to put a lot of time into DreamChess. We're hoping to find some new developers to keep the project development from stalling. If you're interested, please drop us a line (click Contact in the menu on the left).

In other news, DreamChess 0.1.0 has been downloaded over 5000 times since its release back in September.
