title: The mysterious case of the spinning chess board
author: Walter van Niftrik

Several linux users have reported that the chess board in DreamChess keeps spinning around on its own. We'd really like to fix this bug, but unfortunately we cannot reproduce this problem. We're looking for someone to help us out with this, so if you have the spinning board problem and are able to build DreamChess from source, please contact us (feedback at dreamchess.org). Thanks!
